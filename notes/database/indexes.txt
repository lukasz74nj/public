- indexing is a way of sorting a number of records on multiple fields

- creating an index on a field in a table creates another (sorted) data structure
which holds the field value and a pointer to the record it relates to; this allows
binary (vs. linear) searches to be performed, which greatly improves query
performance

- indexes require additional disk space and have to be updated after inserting or
deleting records (which slows down insert/delete operations)
