- index is a data structure that makes the searching faster for a specific column
in a database

- indexes require additional disk space and have to be updated after inserting,
updating or deleting records (which slows down insert/update/delete operations)

- creating an index on a field in a table creates another (sorted) data structure
which holds the field value and a pointer (i.e. a ROWID) to the record it relates
to; this allows binary (vs. linear) searches to be performed, which greatly
improves query performance

- index data structures are grouped together to form index leaf nodes; each leaf
node occupies a single database block or page (the database's smallest storage
unit); leaf nodes are connected to each other using a double linked list (a linked
list is used to make insertion of new indexes faster)
