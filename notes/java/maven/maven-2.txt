1. Setting up a new project:

mvn archetype:create -DgroupId=<group ID> -DartifactId=<artifact ID>

2. Common goals.

- compile
- package
- install
- clean

3. Deploying 3rd party jars to remote repository

Make sure the appropriate wagon provider and any neccessary dependencies are
under $M2_HOME/lib, i.e. for the FTP mechanism the following files are needed:

- wagon-ftp-<version>.jar
- commons-net-<version>.jar
- oro-<version>.jar

Then invoke this command to deploy a file:

mvn deploy:deploy-file
	-DgroupId=<group ID>
	-DartifactId=<artifact ID>
	-Dversion=<version>
	-Dfile=<path to a JAR file>
	-DpomFile=<path to a POM file>
	-Dpackaging=jar
	-DrepositoryId=<repository ID>
	-Durl=<URL to the repository>
	
The repository ID should be configured under ~/.m2/settings.xml.
	
4. Built-in properties

${basedir}
${project.artifactId}
${project.version}
${project.description}
${project.build.directory} => target
${project.build.outputDirectory} => target/classes
${project.build.finalName} => ${project.artifactId}-${project.version}

maven.dependency.classpath - (path ID to be used from Ant)
maven.compile.classpath    - (path ID to be used from Ant)

5. Peforming a release using maven-release-plugin

release:prepare [-DdryRun=true]

(creates release.properties)

- verify that there are no uncommitted changes in the workspace
- prompt the user for the desired tag, release and development version names
- modify and commit release information into the pom.xml file
- tag the entire project source tree with the new tag name

release:perform

(uses release.properties)

- check out the release that was tagged during preparation phase
- execute the maven build lifecycle on the extracted instance of the project
- deploy the release version to appropriate local and remote repositories

release:rollback

(if an SCM tag was generated successfully, it will have to be removed manually)

6. Creating a plugin template

mvn archetype:create
	-DgroupId=com.accoona.maven.plugins
	-DartifactId=maven-accoona-plugin
	-DpackageName=com.accoona.maven.plugins
	-DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-mojo

7. Issues

Per J2EE spec there should be only one version of a class in an application
(i.e. the same class cannot exist both under EAR/ and EAR/WAR/WEB-INF/lib).

All dependencies (including transitive) of a Web module are included under
WEB-INF/lib. All dependencies (including transitive) of other modules (except
Web) inside EAR (i.e. EJB) are included under EAR/. Problem: duplicate classes.
Solution: exclude JARs from WEB-INF/lib and duplicate all dependencies from Web
POM in EAR POM. Problem: why doesn't EAR plugin process these dependencies
automatically, as it does for the EJB module?

8. Misc

mvn help:effective-pom      - shows the final result of the target POM
mvn help:effective-settings - shows effective settings

9. Disabling compilation (and execution) of unit tests on the command-line

-Dmaven.test.skip=true

10. Disabling Javadoc generation on the command-line

-Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true

11. Displaying a list of newer versions of project's dependencies

mvn versions:display-dependency-updates
