- The Get and Put Principle: use an "extends" wildcard when only getting values
out of a structure, use a "super" wildcard when only putting values into a
structure, and don't use a wildcard when both getting and putting values

- it is not allowed to put anything into a type declared with an "extends"
wildcard - except for the value "null", which belongs to every reference type

- since generics are implemented by erasure, a class cannot overload two
methods whose signatures have the same erasure, and a class cannot implement two
interfaces that have the same erasure
