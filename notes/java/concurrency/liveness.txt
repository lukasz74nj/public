Liveness is a concurrent application's ability to execute in a timely manner. The
most common liveness problems:

1) Deadlock

-  two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other

2) Starvation

-  a thread is unable to gain regular access to shared resources and is unable to
make progress

3) Livelock

- threads are unable to make further progress; the threads are not blocked but are
too busy responding to each other to resume work

- this is comparable to two people attempting to pass each other in a corridor,
where both move at the same time to let the other pass
