1) Lock-free synchronization

- optimistic approach using hardware atomic primitives (CAS)

- can cause starvation

- avoids problems with locks (i.e. risk of a deadlock)

- fast under low contention

- simple algorithms

2) Wait-free synchronization

- always finishes in a finite number of its own steps

- less efficient in average than lock-free

- complex algorithms
