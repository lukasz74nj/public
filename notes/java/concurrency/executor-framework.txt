- even when using a fixed-size thread pool the application can run out of memory if the
arrival rate of new requests exceeds the rate at which they can be executed

- the executor framework supports 3 approaches to task queuing: unbounded queue, bounded
queue and synchronous handoff

- the default for executors created via Executors.newFixedThreadPool() and
Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor() is to use an unbounded LinkedBlockingQueue.

- executors created via Executors.newCachedThreadPool() use a SynchronousQueue
