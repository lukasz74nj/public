- while LinkedList also implements Queue - the Queue classes were added because
eliminating the random-access requirements of List admits more efficient
concurrent implementations

- Java 6 adds ConcurrentSkipListMap and ConcurrentSkipListSet, which are
concurrent replacements for synchronized implementations of SortedMap and
SortedSet (such as TreeMap and TreeSet wrapped with synchronizedMap)

- ConcurrentHashMap uses a lock stripping, which permits arbitrarily many
reading threads, concurrent access for readers and writers, and a limited
number of writers to modify the map concurrently
