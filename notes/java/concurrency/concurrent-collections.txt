- while LinkedList also implements Queue - the Queue classes were added because
eliminating the random-access requirements of List admits more efficient
concurrent implementations

- Java 6 adds ConcurrentSkipListMap and ConcurrentSkipListSet, which are
concurrent replacements for synchronized implementations of SortedMap and
SortedSet (such as TreeMap and TreeSet wrapped with synchronizedMap)

- ConcurrentHashMap uses a lock stripping, which permits arbitrarily many
reading threads, concurrent access for readers and writers, and a limited
number of writers to modify the map concurrently

- concurrent collections provide iterators that do not throw
ConcurrentModificationException, thus eliminating the need to lock the
collection during iteration (iterators are weakly consistent instead of
fail-fast); a weakly consistent iterator can tolerate concurrent modification,
traverses elements as they existed when the iterator was constructed, and may
(but is not guaranteed to) reflect modification to the collection after the
construction of the iterator
