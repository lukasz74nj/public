- concurrent collections provide iterators that do not throw
ConcurrentModificationException, thus eliminating the need to lock the
collection during iteration (iterators are weakly consistent instead of
fail-fast); a weakly consistent iterator can tolerate concurrent modification,
traverses elements as they existed when the iterator was constructed, and may
(but is not guaranteed to) reflect modification to the collection after the
construction of the iterator

- while LinkedList also implements Queue - the Queue classes were added because
eliminating the random-access requirements of List admits more efficient
concurrent implementations

- Java 6 adds ConcurrentSkipListMap and ConcurrentSkipListSet, which are
concurrent replacements for synchronized SortedMap and SortedSet
implementations (such as TreeMap and TreeSet wrapped with synchronizedMap)

- Java 6 adds Deque and BlockingDeque implementations that allow insertion and
removal from both the head and the tail; just as blocking queues lend themselves
to a producer-consumer pattern, deques lend themselves to a work stealing
pattern, where every consumer has its own deque and if a consumer exhausts the
work in its own deque, it can steal work from the tail of someone else's deque 

- ConcurrentHashMap uses a lock stripping, which permits arbitrarily many
reading threads, concurrent access for readers and writers, and a limited
number of writers to modify the map concurrently

- CopyOnWriteArrayList and CopyOnWriteArraySet are concurrent replacements for
synchronized List and Set implementations
