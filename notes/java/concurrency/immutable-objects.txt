- an object is immutable if its state cannot be modified after construction, all
fields are final and it is properly constructed (the "this" reference doesn't
escape during construction)

- immutable objects are always thread-safe and synchronization is not required
to publish objects' references (initialization safety guaranteed by the Java
Memory Model)
