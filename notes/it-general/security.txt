1. Enable network debugging for IBM JVMs

javax.net.debug=true

2. Default key/trust store password in WebSphere

WebAS

3. Empty passwords for keys in key databases

ikeyman uses empty passwords for keys
keytool requires key passwords to be at least 6 characters long

4. Import a PKCS12 certificate using ikeyman

Replace the following IBM SDK policy files with unrestricted ones (IBM's SDKs
ship with strong but limited jurisdiction policy files):

local_policy.jar
US_export_policy.jar

5. (WAS 6.1) If an SSL configuration specifies a client authentication alias,
the corresponding certificate is being used regardless whether SSL client
authentication is enabled or not (a bug?).

6. Default trust store in WebSphere

These are not used unless global security is enabled. If global security is
disabled, JDK's trust store is used:

$WAS_HOME/java/jre/lib/security/cacerts

7. Default trust store in Java

$JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts

Password: changeit

8. Java SSL properties

javax.net.ssl.trustStore
javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword

9. Enabling environment for cross-cell EJB calls (between server A in cell C1
and server B in cell C2); global security enabled at both ends and C1 and C2
configured with the same or some different user registry

On server A, cell C1 (the sender - EJB client):

- enable identity assertion (CSIv2 outbound authentication)
- disable security attribute propagation (CSIv2 outbound authentication)
- create a user in the file based repository for authenticating to JNDI

On server B, cell C2 (the receiver - EJB):

- enable identity assertion (CSIv2 inbound authentication)
- specify the "*" ID in trusted identities list (CSIv2 inbound authentication)
- create a user in the file based repository for authenticating to JNDI
- grant the above user "Cos Naming Read" CORBA permission

Both user credentials need to be the same (username and password).
