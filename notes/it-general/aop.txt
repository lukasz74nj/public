Aspects are described in terms of advice, pointcuts and join points.

Advice - describes the job that an aspect will perform and when to perform the
job (i.e. before/after a method is invoked).

Join point - is a point in the execution of the application where an aspect can
be plugged in (i.e. method being called, an exception being thrown, field being
modified).

Pointcut - a pointcut definition matches one or more join points at which an
advice should be woven; pointcuts help narrow down the join points advised by an
aspect.

Weaving - is the process of applying aspects to a target object to create a new
proxied object (in Spring aspects are woven at runtime).
