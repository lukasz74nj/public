1. Setting up a repository.

# cvs -d <CVS-root> init

2. The password file.

$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/passwd

format:

<cvs-user-name>:[cvs-user-password][:system-user-name]

If a user entry is not present CVS falls back to use system
authentication (unless SystemAuth=no in the config file).

CVS users can share the same system user name (the default
is "cvs" and has to be present in /etc/passwd).
