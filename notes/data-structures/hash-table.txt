1) Overview

- a load factor is a measure of how full the hash table is allowed to get before its
capacity is automatically increased; when the number of entries in the hash table
exceeds the product of the load factor and the current capacity, the hash table is
rehashed

- a 0.75 load factor offers a good tradeoff between time and space costs

2) Collision resolution

2.1) Separate chaining

- separate chaining with linked lists
	
2.2) Open addressing

- all entry records are stored in the bucket array itself; when a new entry has to be
inserted, the buckets are examined, starting with the hashed-to slot and proceeding
in some probe sequence, until an unoccupied slot is found

- a drawback of all open addressing schemes is that the number of stored entries
cannot exceed the number of slots in the bucket array

- linear probing (the interval between probes is fixed, usually 1)

- quadratic probing (the interval between probes is increased using a quadratic
function)

- double hashing (the interval between probes is computed using another hash
function)
